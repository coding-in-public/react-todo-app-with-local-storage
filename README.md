To get a project up and running:
1. Unzip the project you downloaded.
2. Open the unzipped directory in you code editor.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the app.

## Assumptions
In this series, I’ll assume you have a working knowledge of HTML and vanilla JavaScript. It would also help to have a basic understanding of React.
